    "We need to propose 3 topics for our capstone project and share it in the class (lightning talk) to discuss about:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. What is your problem statement?  What will you actually be doing?\n",
    "2. Who is your audience?  Why will they care?\n",
    "3. What is your success metric?  How will you know if you are actually solving the problem in a useful way?\n",
    "4. What is your data source?  What format is your data in?  How much cleaning and munging will be required?\n",

    "Think about your talk as a short pitch.  It will be helpful to practice your talk beforehand!  Keep it short, succinct and to the point.\n",

    "**HAVE YOUR DATA IN HAND AS SOON AS POSSIBLE**\n",
    "\n",
    "There is no penalty for having to switch topics or datasets in the middle of the project, provided that you can still deliver on the other portions of this work. However, if you can get the data in hand as soon as possible, you can prevent yourself a lot of extra work. \n",
