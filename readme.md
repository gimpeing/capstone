# Capstone

## Overview

This is my captone project journey in GA DSI13

## Topic selections

We need to propose 3 topics for our capstone project and share it in the class (lightning talk) to discuss about:

1. What is your problem statement?  What will you actually be doing?
2. Who is your audience?  Why will they care?
3. What is your success metric?  How will you know if you are actually solving the problem in a useful way?
4. What is your data source?  What format is your data in?  How much cleaning and munging will be required?
5. What are potential challenges or obstacles and how will you mitigate them?
6. Is this a reasonable project given the time constraints that you have?
